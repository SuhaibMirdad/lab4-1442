        <header> What is HTML? </header>
        <p><small>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links,
            and blockquotes for web pages and applications, HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic
            functionality Instead it makes it possible to organize and format documents similarly to Microsoft Word.
            </small></p>
        
        <header>The History of HTML</header>
        <p><small>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. He came up with the idea of an Internet-based hypertext system.
           Hypertext means a text that contains references (links) to other texts that viewers can access immediately. He published the first version of HTML in 1991, consisting of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes (tag modifiers) to the markup.
